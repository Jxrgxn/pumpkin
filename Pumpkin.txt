-	add remaining features from original/Cocos2D version
	-	particles
	-	ball trail
	-	bouncy lines

-	port to Metal (keep OpenGL handy too?)
	-	how to load textures?

-	convert GLKit vector stuff to simd
	-	https://github.com/raywenderlich/SKTUtils/tree/master/SKTUtils
	-	probably add my own helper functions
	-	https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/MetalBasic3D/Listings/MetalBasic3D_AAPLTransforms_mm.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014603-MetalBasic3D_AAPLTransforms_mm-DontLinkElementID_7
	-	see Metal by Example for helper functions

-	make sure nodes and sprites get deallocated etc
-	timers: what happens if there is a big shift in system time (because
	the game was paused etc)?
-	put in git repo
-	also on iPhone (just scale from 1024x768 scene to device size?)
-	add a delay of a second before showing everything

-	clean up code: make more Swift-like
	-	clean up the OpenGL shit
		https://github.com/joshb/CocoaOpenGL-Swift/tree/master/CocoaOpenGL-Swift
		https://github.com/bradley/iOSSwiftOpenGL
	-	Node.sprite should automatically unwrap already (shape too)
			and give error message if no sprite set
	-	put into its own Module
	-	organize the classes into groups (Tweens, Scene Graph, OpenGL, etc)
