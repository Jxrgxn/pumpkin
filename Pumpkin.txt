Pumpkin in Swift + Metal

-	add remaining features from original/Cocos2D version
	-	particles
	-	ball trail
	-	bouncy lines

-	port to Metal (keep OpenGL handy too?)
	-	how to load textures?

-	when starting up, sometimes the bricks don't scale down properly;
	is this because the ball already hits some bricks and they jelly?
	(does this happen on the obj-c version too?)
-	add a delay of a second before showing everything
-	timers: what happens if there is a big shift in system time (because
	the game was paused etc)? (For Timer this is no problem, but what
	about times that use CACurrentMediaTime()?)
-	also on iPhone (just scale from 1024x768 scene to device size?)

-	clean up code: make more Swift-like
	-	clean up the OpenGL shit
		https://github.com/joshb/CocoaOpenGL-Swift/tree/master/CocoaOpenGL-Swift
		https://github.com/bradley/iOSSwiftOpenGL

-	use as few ! and ? as possible...
-	ShaderAttributes.texCoord.rawValue
-	RenderingEngine: 
	-	OpenGL/Metal-specific RenderingEngines? (+ better name for this!)
	-	don't initialize with OpenGLView? do we need layer + viewportsize?
	-	better name
	-	does Engine really need to have a reference to RenderingEngine?
		or should I let ViewController handle that? (so that we really
		have a clean split between the scenegraph and the drawing)
-	Visual has too many properties: Shape doesn't need the ones used by
	Sprite.
-	Tweenable: It now has two sections: for Node and for Sprite
	-	BasicTween cannot have "target" then; this must be in the
		subclasses only (don't know if that is a problem)
	-	maybe PositionTweenable, ScaleTween(able), etc.
-	rename ViewController to Game

-	Sprite: 
	-	boundingBox
	-	texturedQuad
	-	how to get a pointer to just the quad?
